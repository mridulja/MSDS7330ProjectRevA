# MSDS7330ProjectRevA
MSDS7330 Project work - Initial Repository setup

This Repository is created to work on the MSDS7330 project "STREAMING ANALYTICS OF SPORTS RELATED TWEETS USING APACHE SPARK"

I.	INTRODUCTION
Our research methodology will focus on implementing a solution that will be used to gather sentiment or other interesting information using the tweets related to sporting events. For example, when Dallas Cowboys play the Eagles, we will process all the tweets that use the hashtags associated with this game to find information such as the following: 
1.	Which payers are mentioned the most
2.	Number of tweets that mentioned referees 
3.	Search for certain words that indicate positive sentiment about a team
4.	Search for certain words that indicate negative sentiment about a team
5.	Search for any marketing messages included in the tweets
6.	Use the Geo location feature of the tweets to determine the heat map of the areas where the games is the most tweeted about.
7.	Determine the timeline based distribution of number of tweets.


II.	THE GOAL IS TO CREATE AN APPROPRIATE DATA STRUCTURE APPROPRIATE FOR STORING AND ACCESSING THE RESULTS
A statement of previous work related to the problem:
We are new to Analytics, and although familiar with social media, we have no experience with streaming Analytics. However, there are many projects that use twitter and social media Analytics.


III.	MILESTONES
o	Week 6: Milestone 1: Setup local environment  and source control solution 
o	Week 7: Milestone 2: Simple example of twitter processing to verify environment and become familiar with Spark
o	Week 8: Milestone 3: Establish production environment and verify it using a simple example from Milestone 3
o	Week 9: Milestone 4: Implement code need to process tweets to gather desired results mentioned above.
o	Week 10: Milestone 5: Create a database solution for storing and querying of the results.
o	Week 11: Milestone 6: Deploy solution to the production environment and collect results for several sporting events.
o	Week 12: Milestone 7: Address any production issues or corrections needed.
o	Week 13: Milestone 8: Publish result and prepare final presentation.
o	Week 14: Milestone 9: Complete the project paper
